 Mini Challenge #9 Restaurant Picker
 This is a console project that gives the user three categories to choice from and each has
 10 restaurants. The program will then pick a random restaurent in the chosen category

Peer Reviewed by Isaiah Ferguson - The program runs ass intended i really like the idea of having all as a choice and leaving it up to chance. the program loops as great and i didn't find any errors also Texas RoadHouse is the Best Restaurant on the list!!
